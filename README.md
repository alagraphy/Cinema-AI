# AI-Cinema-AI

Cinema-AI or CinemAI is a text2Film or text2Movie adapted from OpenAI's CLIPS Text2Image DALL-E enhanced by @advnoun's Aleph2Image. Check out my youtube channel and twitter for some of the output examples.

All you have to do is edit the text that is split by new lines to create each image.

Feel free to use it and make wonderful AI-generated films. I'd love to see what you come up with. Please mention me on twitter, medium, instagram, youtube, facebook: @alagraphy
